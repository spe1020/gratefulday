## Nostr Implementation

### Custom Event Kind: 36669

The application uses a custom addressable event kind for storing gratitude entries:

- **Kind**: `36669` (Addressable/Replaceable)
- **Purpose**: Daily gratitude reflections
- **Tags**:
  - `d`: Date identifier (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `published_at`: Unix timestamp
  - `day`: Day of year (1-365/366)
  - `alt`: Human-readable description

See [NIP.md](./NIP.md) for full specification.

### Relay Configuration

The app uses NIP-65 relay management with these default relays:
- wss://relay.ditto.pub
- wss://relay.nostr.band
- wss://relay.damus.io

Users can manage their relay connections through the settings.
